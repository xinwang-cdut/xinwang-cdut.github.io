  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Earthquake-triggered (coseismic) landsliding is among the most lethal of disasters, and rapid response is crucial to prevent cascading hazards that further threaten lives and infrastructure. Current prediction approaches are limited by oversimplified physical models, regionally focused databases, and retrospective statistical methods, which impede timely and accurate hazard assessments. To overcome these constraints, we developed the first comprehensive global database of ∼400 000 landslides associated with 38 of the most catastrophic earthquakes over the past 50 years. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed advanced deep-learning models that predict the probability of landsliding for any earthquake worldwide with an average spatial accuracy of ∼82\% in less than a minute, without relying on prior local knowledge. Our framework enables swift disaster evaluation during the critical early hours following an earthquake while also enhancing pre-event hazard planning. This study offers a scalable and efficient tool to mitigate the catastrophic impacts of earthquake-triggered landslides, representing a transformative advance in global geohazard prediction.},

 abstract = {Abstract A powerful earthquake, particularly in mountainous regions, has the ability to trigger an immense number of landslides, resulting in severe damages. However, effectively assessing their recoveries in the years following the mainshocks has not yet been attempted due to the lack of continuously updated landslide inventories. Therefore, we proposed a novel detection framework utilizing time-series Landsat images from 2000 to 2021, which enabled us to achieve a long-term landslide inventory in the seismic zone for the first time. The response patterns of landslide development under different conditions were explored in detail. The restoration models were quantitatively established, revealing that the recoveries of post-earthquake landslide activity and vital environmental indicators require a range from ∼5.29 to ∼25.00 years. This pioneering research is highly beneficial in comprehending the impact of earthquake-induced hazards on short-term land surface damage and long-term ecological equilibrium.},

  abstract = {On September 5, 2022, an Ms6.8 earthquake struck Luding County, Sichuan Province, China. Through creating a coseismic landslide prediction model, we obtained the spatial distribution of the triggered geological hazards immediately after the earthquake. Through collecting all available multi-source optical remote sensing images of the earthquake-affected area via UAV and satellite platforms, the exact information of coseismic landslide was achieved by pattern recognition and visual inspection. According to the current results, the Luding earthquake triggered 5336 landslides with a total area of 28.53km2. The spatial distribution of the coseismic landslides is correlated statistically to various seismic, terrain, and geological factors, to evaluate their susceptibility at regional scale and to identify the most typical characteristics of these failures. The results reveal that the coseismic landslides mainly occurred on the sides of the Xianshuihe fault (within 1.2 km) and Dadu River (within 0.5 km) in striped patterns. They are concentrated in the regions with an elevation range of 1000–1800 m, a slope range of 25–55°, and lithologies of acid plutonic rocks, mixed sedimentary rocks, and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Besides, the coseismic landslides of the Luding earthquake are smaller in size and shallower than those triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake. Rapidly achieving the spatial locations and distribution patterns of the coseismic landslides enables to provide effective support and guidance to emergency rescue, risk mitigation, and reconstruction planning.},

  abstract = {Detailed land cover change trajectory offers a better opportunity for understanding the dynamic of land surface process. However, change information contained in training samples, which are usually difficult to obtain, needs to be provided in advance to achieve such goal within a complex scenario. A novel multiple change detection approach, namely Tri-temporal Logic-verified Change Vector Analysis (TLCVA) in posterior Probability Space (TLCVAPS), was proposed in this paper. It removes the dependence on change class information contained in training samples, while reducing the detection errors by taking change logic into account for the first time. The proposed approach consists of three steps, including: (1) change vector produced in posterior probability space, (2) binary change detection via TLCVA, and (3) change trajectory identification through combining change vector angle comparison and logic verification in change pattern. We applied the proposed approach on three tri-temporal datasets obtained in Nanjing, Xianning, and Zhenjiang, China, respectively. The results confirmed the superiority of TLCVAPS in comparison with state-of-the-art multiple change detection methods with the same prior knowledge.},

Most co-seismic landslide mapping is primarily achieved via field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly over large areas. This paper proposed an automated co-seismic landslide mapping approach, which has three main advantages compared to state-of-the-art methods. First, it removes the dependence on the manual labeling for training samples through an unsupervised change detection process. Second, the approach takes the lead in introducing multi-scale extended morphological profiles to comprehensively describe the characteristics of various landslides induced by earthquake. Third, it is also the first attempt to employ ensemble strategy in landslide identification, which integrates the advantages of different machine learning-based classifiers, further improving the accuracy of recognition. Three experiments were carried out through multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images acquired in China and Haiti. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach compared to other methods, providing an effective solution for complicated co-seismic landslide mapping task in the future.},

  abstract = {Continuous urban expansion and its influence on land surface phenology (LSP) have been gaining considerable attention due to their impacts on climate change, carbon cycling and human health. Most previous studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on LSP from the regional to global scales by using coarse-resolution remotely sensed images and fixed land cover boundary maps. However, the influences of urbanization on LSP are also important at the local level, particularly in and around rapidly urbanizing cities as LSP is closely linked to the local ecology and people’s health. To analyze the dynamic of urbanization and its effect on LSP at the local scale, this study proposed a novel framework of characterizing LSP with consideration of continuous urban expansion based on all available time-series Landsat and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Reflectance and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) composite data. The proposed approach was capable of evaluating LSP impacts of urbanization from three aspects: 1) the phenology difference between dynamic annual urban and rural areas; 2) the different rates of phenology trend between the permanent urban and rural areas; and 3) the phenology shifts in the areas that were urbanized during the period. This approach was applied to Nanjing, China and the experimental results indicated that when compared with the rural areas, the phenology cycle started 0.59 ± 0.58 days earlier (start of season, SOS) and ended 1.65 ± 1.55 days later (end of season, EOS) in urban areas, accordingly leading to increased growing season length (GSL) by 2.77 ± 2.61 days. Besides, the experiments also revealed that 70.81% SOS and 78.79% EOS in the permanent urban-rural areas were provided with delayed phenology trends, along with 80.72% of these regions tending to have a prolonged GSL. Furthermore, the rates of SOS and EOS delay in rural areas were 0.12 ± 0.12 day/year and 0.02 ± 0.02 day/year faster than those in urban areas, and the rate of GSL prolonging in urban regions was 0.04 ± 0.04 day/year faster than that in rural counterparts. For the urbanized regions in Nanjing, after experiencing conversion to the impervious surface, SOS and EOS delayed in 65.77% and 70.33% of the regions, accompanied by extended GSL in 70.83% of the regions. Overall, this research proposed a novel approach of analyzing urbanization implications for LSP at the city scale and demonstrated its priority of taking continuous land cover change into account.},

  abstract = {Detailed land cover change in multitemporal images is an important application for earth science. Many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem in different ways. However, accurately identifying changes still remains a challenge due to the difficulties in describing the characteristics of various change categories by using single-level features. In this article, a multilevel feature representation framework was designed to build robust feature set for complex change detection task. First, four different levels of information from low level to high level, including pixel-level, neighborhood-level, object-level, and scene-level features, were extracted. Through the operation of extracting different level features from multitemporal images, the differences between them can be described comprehensively. Second, multilevel features were fused to reduce the dimension and then used as the input for supervised change detector with initial limited labels. Finally, for reducing the labeling cost and improving the change detection results simultaneously, active learning was conducted to select the most informative samples for labeling, and this step together with the previous steps were iteratively conducted to improve the results in each round. Experimental results of three pairs of real remote sensing datasets demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the influences of scene scale for high-level semantic features in the proposed approach on change detection performance were also analyzed and discussed.},

In order to address this problem, the importances of multi-attribute APs, which are generated by ranges of thresholds, are calculated in advance. The APs with higher importances are chosen as input features for change detectors. Furthermore, owing to the possible incomplete feature importance model caused by randomness and small size of selected training samples through random forest, an ensemble method is conducted by integrating different results to enhance the stability of the final output. Experimental results obtained by two pairs of bi-temporal HR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
