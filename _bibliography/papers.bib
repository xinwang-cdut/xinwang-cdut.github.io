  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Earthquake-triggered (coseismic) landsliding is among the most lethal of disasters, and rapid response is crucial to prevent cascading hazards that further threaten lives and infrastructure. Current prediction approaches are limited by oversimplified physical models, regionally focused databases, and retrospective statistical methods, which impede timely and accurate hazard assessments. To overcome these constraints, we developed the first comprehensive global database of ∼400 000 landslides associated with 38 of the most catastrophic earthquakes over the past 50 years. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed advanced deep-learning models that predict the probability of landsliding for any earthquake worldwide with an average spatial accuracy of ∼82\% in less than a minute, without relying on prior local knowledge. Our framework enables swift disaster evaluation during the critical early hours following an earthquake while also enhancing pre-event hazard planning. This study offers a scalable and efficient tool to mitigate the catastrophic impacts of earthquake-triggered landslides, representing a transformative advance in global geohazard prediction.},

 abstract = {Abstract A powerful earthquake, particularly in mountainous regions, has the ability to trigger an immense number of landslides, resulting in severe damages. However, effectively assessing their recoveries in the years following the mainshocks has not yet been attempted due to the lack of continuously updated landslide inventories. Therefore, we proposed a novel detection framework utilizing time-series Landsat images from 2000 to 2021, which enabled us to achieve a long-term landslide inventory in the seismic zone for the first time. The response patterns of landslide development under different conditions were explored in detail. The restoration models were quantitatively established, revealing that the recoveries of post-earthquake landslide activity and vital environmental indicators require a range from ∼5.29 to ∼25.00 years. This pioneering research is highly beneficial in comprehending the impact of earthquake-induced hazards on short-term land surface damage and long-term ecological equilibrium.},
