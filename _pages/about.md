I am Xin Wang ([王欣](https://faculty.cdut.edu.cn/WX1234567891011121314151617181920/zh_CN/index/280532/list/index.htm) in Chinese), currently an associate professor at the [State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection](https://sklgp.cdut.edu.cn/en/) (SKLGP). My research centers on remote sensing geoscience analysis, where I closely integrate cutting-edge techniques, including image pattern recognition, spatial big data analytics, and artificial intelligence algorithms, with the pressing needs of geohazard prevention and mitigation.

Leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I focus on addressing critical challenges in geohazard management, particularly in the early identification of hidden dangers, near-real-time prediction, post-event mapping, and long-term effect analysis of geological hazards induced by earthquakes and extreme climates. Through these efforts, I have developed a series of original research outcomes that provide robust theoretical frameworks and technical solutions to support disaster prevention, mitigation, and emergency response.

We recruit master students in Geological Engineering, Remote Sensing Science and Technology, Geographic Information Systems, and Surveying and Mapping Engineering. Our team leads various national and provincial research projects and collaborates closely with top universities and research institutes worldwide, offering broad development opportunities. Prospective students are welcome to inquire and apply.
