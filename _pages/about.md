I am Xin Wang ([王欣](https://faculty.cdut.edu.cn/WX1234567891011121314151617181920/zh_CN/index/280532/list/index.htm)), an Associate Professor at the [State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection](https://sklgp.cdut.edu.cn/en/), [Chengdu University of Technology](https://www.cdut.edu.cn/en/). My primary research centers on remote sensing geoscience analysis, where I closely integrate cutting-edge techniques, including image pattern recognition, spatial big data analytics, and artificial intelligence algorithms, with the pressing needs of geohazard prevention and mitigation.

Leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I focus on addressing critical challenges in geohazard management, particularly in the early identification of hidden dangers, near-real-time prediction, post-event mapping, and long-term effect analysis of geological hazards induced by earthquakes and extreme climates. Through these efforts, I have developed a series of original research outcomes that provide robust theoretical frameworks and technical solutions to support disaster prevention, mitigation, and emergency response.

My work aims to bridge the gap between advanced geospatial technologies and real-world hazard management, contributing to more resilient strategies for disaster risk reduction.
